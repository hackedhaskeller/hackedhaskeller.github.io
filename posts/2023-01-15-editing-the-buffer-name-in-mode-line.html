        <p>I work on projects that have nested file that can be named
similar. Often when I view those files in Emacs only the file name is
shown. If there is a conflict then a it goes up the file tree until
the two file have a parent folder that is named differently and shows
that; However, that can be confusing if you look down and see a folder
that isn’t the direct parents in front of the file name.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem?</h2>
<p>For example if you had a tree structure like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some Project
<ul>
<li>Some Folder
<ul>
<li>Some Child Folder
<ul>
<li>Some File.md</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some Other Project
<ul>
<li>Some Folder
<ul>
<li>Some Child Folder
<ul>
<li>Some File.md</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>And you opened both <code>Some File.md</code> files then one of the buffers would
be called <code>Some Project/Some File.md</code> and the other <code>Some Other Project/Some File.md</code>, which is confusing as <code>Some File.md</code> isn’t
directly in either of the root folders. I set out to change that and
it wasn’t as easy as I was hoping.</p>

<li>Didn’t help much https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Mode-Line.html</li>

<li>Discovered that <code>'(:eval ...</code> was essentially a D.S.L. for mode-line details</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>As a e-lisp learner I’m sure this is the most efficient nor best code possible, but it seems to work.</p>
<pre class="emacs-lisp"><code>(defun somefunctionprefix--calculated-buffer-name ()
  (let ((bfn buffer-file-name))
    (if bfn
        (let ((n (substring bfn (string-width (projectile-project-root)))))
          (let ((sw (string-width n))
                (cut 50)
                )
            (if (&gt; sw cut)
                (substring n (- sw cut))
              n)
            )
          )
      (buffer-name)
      )
    )
  )

(setq-default mode-line-buffer-identification
              (list '(:eval (propertized-buffer-identification (somefunctionprefix--calculated-buffer-name)))))
</code></pre>
<h2 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h2>
<p>I want to thank everyone that contributes to Emacs and its
documentation. I know it must be difficult making things easy to
understand for new comers like me. A special thanks goes out to
<a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/users/6701/yphil">yPhil</a> for their
<a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/63584">answer on StackExchange</a>
without which I’m sure I would of been lost for a long time.</p>
